 Rails library was built to assume everything that a programmer could need. That is why it is essential to go slowly, learning the right way to get all the benefits of this library, and if you adopt the wrong behaviors, this will decrease your productivity in comparison to the other programmers 
it is better to learn Ruby before starting learning Rails 
it has two significant philosophies
first, Don't repeat your self which means you will have access to variables from any place in the project as needed 
second convention over configuration, which means the creators of this library thought and crafted every step that might any programmer go through and made an intelligent way and shortcode to achieve the goal 
 it has autoloading you don't need to use required
lib directory for extended modules
 the only place to use (require) is to require module from the lib directory or to load gem dependencies from the gem file that has required: false in the gem file
App file is where we will build our application
Config file to configure our application
Db file for database
Gem file for gems
To start the server, use bin\rails server
To make a controller use( bin/rails generate controller controller-name action-name)
To make a model use (bin/rails generate model model-name attribute-name: type, attribute-name: type, â€¦.)
To make the table in the database, we use (bin/rails db:migrate)
To interact with the database, we use irb and to start irb session is by using (bin/rails console)
In irb session, we can add elements to a table by using (singular-name-of-the-table = singular-name-of-the-table. new(and update the columns), then use singular-name-of-the-table. save to add the changes to the table
And by using singular-name-of-the-table or singular-name-of-the-table.all or singular-name-of-the-table.find(), we can retrieve the elements from that table
This <%%> tag means read the ruby code in erb files
And this tag <%= %> is to read and return ruby code in erb files
The flow of the code is by starting a request from a client which will hit the server on the listening channel, which will send the request to the routes which will match the action and the path which will trigger the action in that controller, which will process data or call the model to reach data in the database and return to the attribute in the action which will pass these data through that attribute to the view Html 
 If we use (resources) in routes this will give move convention by accessing different routes through one line for the same controller
Also (resources) sets up Path and URL helper functions to be added to the controller name to be able to access these actions under this controller without using slashes 
To create an element in a table we need to build actions to handle creation
We have 2 functions to do that 
First (new) which will create the element but will not save it in the database and the made element will be used in the view to build a form
Second (create) which will have the option of saving the built element in the database but we need to pass (redirect_to) to prevent inputing the same element multiple time tby refreshing the page and this function will wrok by making the client request a new request which will take the page to the made element for example.
